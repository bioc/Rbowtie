Description: This package provides an R wrapper around the popular
        bowtie short read aligner and around SpliceMap, a de novo
        splice junction discovery and alignment tool. The package is
        used by the QuasR bioconductor package. We recommend to use the
        QuasR package instead of using Rbowtie directly.
